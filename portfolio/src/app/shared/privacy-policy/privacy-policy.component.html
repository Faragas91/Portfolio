        <h2 id="m2427">Applicable Legal Bases</h2>
        <p><strong>Applicable Legal Bases under the GDPR:</strong> Below is an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or headquarters. Should more specific legal bases be relevant in individual cases, we will inform you about them in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given consent to the processing of personal data concerning him or her for one or more specific purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Contract Performance and Pre-contractual Inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Obligation (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>National Data Protection Regulations in Austria:</strong> In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national regulations on data protection apply in Austria. These include, in particular, the Federal Act on the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the Processing of Personal Data (Data Protection Act - DSG). The Data Protection Act contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to rectification or erasure, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transfer as well as automated decision-making in individual cases.</p>

        <p><strong>Note on the Applicability of the GDPR and Swiss FADP:</strong> This privacy notice serves to provide information in accordance with both the Swiss FADP and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, please note that the terms of the GDPR are used due to their broader geographical application and comprehensibility. In particular, instead of the terms “processing” of “personal data,” “overriding interest,” and “sensitive personal data” used in the Swiss FADP, the terms “processing” of “personal data,” “legitimate interest,” and “special categories of data” used in the GDPR are used. However, the legal meaning of the terms will continue to be determined in accordance with the Swiss FADP within the scope of the Swiss FADP.</p>

        <h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
        <p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in accordance with legal requirements.</p>

        <p>The measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access, input, disclosure, availability, and separation of the data. Furthermore, we have established procedures that ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data threats. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software, and processes in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design, and data protection-friendly default settings.</p>

        <h2 id="m25">Transfer of Personal Data</h2>
        <p>When we process personal data, it may be transferred to other entities, companies, legally independent organizational units, or individuals or disclosed to them. The recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we observe the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude corresponding contracts or agreements with the recipients of your data that serve to protect your data.</p>

        <h2 id="m12">General Information on Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>We delete personal data we process in accordance with legal provisions as soon as the underlying consents are withdrawn or there are no further legal grounds for processing. This applies to cases where the original purpose of processing ceases to exist or the data is no longer required. Exceptions to this rule apply if legal obligations or special interests require a longer retention or archiving of the data.</p>
        <p>In particular, data that must be retained for commercial or tax reasons, or whose storage is necessary for legal prosecution or to protect the rights of other natural or legal persons, must be archived accordingly.</p>
        <p>Our data protection notices contain additional information on the retention and deletion of data that specifically apply to certain processing operations.</p>
        <p>If there are multiple indications of a retention period or deletion deadline for a piece of data, the longest period always applies.</p>
        <p>If a deadline does not explicitly start on a specific date and lasts at least one year, it automatically begins at the end of the calendar year in which the triggering event occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual relationships in which data is stored, the triggering event is the time of termination or other ending of the legal relationship.</p>
        <p>Data that is no longer needed for the original intended purpose but is retained due to legal requirements or other reasons will be processed solely for the purposes that justify its retention.</p>
